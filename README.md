# Object-detection

Currently, the model can detect objects in images, but its object list is limited and requires expansion to recognize a wider range of objects. It not only detects but also counts the objects, announcing aloud the types and quantities present. This feature can be particularly beneficial for visually impaired individuals, allowing them to hear a description of the objects in the image. Additionally, the code can be modified to accept live video input, enabling real-time object detection in videos or from any specified video source.
